I'm a Full Stack Web Developer who primarily works in the front end.  I am a reformed teacher turned programmer who loves all things code and technology.  I was born and raised in Wisconsin and then saw the light by becoming a Gopher at The University of Minnesota (Row the Boat!). I have lived in South Korea for the past 12 years and made a great life with my amazing wife and hilarious son.  

I am currently lead developer for a fashion AR / VR platform.  I also try to blog when time allows for [FreeCodeCamp](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/building-a-calculator-with-react-hooks-and-react-context-api-debcabbc5f54) and contribute to open-source software when I'm not entertaining a toddler.  I also love cooking and brewing beer.
